This program is for CS 250 Object Oriented Programming. When run in any Java
compiler (I am using IntelliJ) a window will appear and you can use Paint which is very similar
to Microsoft Paint. If you would like to know more about what works and what does not please go to the Sprint notes

When running please compile and run the Paint.java file which is located in 
Paints/src/main/java/com/example/paints/. 


Also when running this make sure ou change the hard codded directories which are needed to your directory
